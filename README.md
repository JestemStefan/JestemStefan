# Hello, I'm Bartosz! :wave:

<br />

<b>I'm Django Developer, former Scientins, hobby Game Designer and a FOSS contributor. </b>

Currently, Iâ€™m working in an international team of developers on the multi-tenant payment platform backend built in the Django Rest Framework.

My daily tasks consist of designing and developing new features using best programming practices, refactoring, debugging and of course learning.

In free time I work on FOSS projects and collaborate in Game Jams :joystick:
